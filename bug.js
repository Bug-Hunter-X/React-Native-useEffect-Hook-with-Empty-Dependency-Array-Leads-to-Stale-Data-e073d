This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an empty dependency array (`[]`).  While seemingly innocuous, this setup can cause unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or external state changes.  The hook's intent is to run only once on mount; however, if there are asynchronous calls or external dependencies that change after the initial render, the effect won't re-run, leading to stale data or incorrect UI updates.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Asynchronous API call
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => setData(data));
}, []); // Empty dependency array
```
